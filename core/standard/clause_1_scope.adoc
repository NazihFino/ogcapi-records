== Scope

This document specifies the behaviour of an API that supports the ability to
search collections of descriptive information, called records, about resources
such as data collections, services, processes, styles, code lists and other
related resources.  Records represent resource characteristics that can be
queried and presented for evaluation and further processing by both humans
and software.

This specification defines a list of core queryables and a set of core query
parameter organized into X conformance classes.
