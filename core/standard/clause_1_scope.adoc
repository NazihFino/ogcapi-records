== Scope
This document specifies the behaviour of Web APIs the provide discovery capabilities to the existence of resources (data,
services, styles, processes, etc.) in a manner which is independent of the underlying repository.  This standard defines
discovery and search operations.

Discovery operations enable clients to interrogate the API to determine its capabilities and retrieve information about
this distribution of the dataset, including the API definition and metadata about the record collections provided by the API.

Search operations enable clients to interrogate the API with mass-market / search engine style parameters to facilitate
further lowering the barrier to finding the existence of spatial resources on the Web.
